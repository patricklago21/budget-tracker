This project was built for Week 19 of the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. This week covered Progressive Web Applications. By utilizing MongoDb, a service worker, and JSON manifest, this application has offline capabilities. If the user loses internet connection while adding or subtracting funds, their actions will be saved and restored when the user regains internet connection.
